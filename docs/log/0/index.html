<p>I won&rsquo;t beat around the bush. College isn&rsquo;t doing it for me, not that I should be surprised. And it&rsquo;s annoying that I have to waste time to maintain a minimum attendance of 75% for all classes. . I&rsquo;ve been fooling around for way too long, and it&rsquo;s time to get serious. This is the goal: Speedrun the fundamentals of software engineering. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean sacrificing quality, but my aim is to e.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s time to organize life. At least the academics part. Time to VCS it.</p>
<p>Quality education is free nowadays, provided you have a decent internet connection. But you need proper resources or resourceful enough to know where to look for it. Luckily for comp grads, most of the books can be found on the surface web for free. And even if not, it more likely than not exists on shadow libraries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m roughly following teachyourselfcs, but since my goal is to speedrun it in 2 semesters, I need to pick and choose. Of course I want to touch on the other topics as well, but they aren&rsquo;t high on my priority list as of right now.
I also do want to gain a solid grasp of Computer Science, but I feel like that will demand greater attention, and I definitely do not want to rush that so I&rsquo;ll probably start that one out</p>
<p>Too many people want to try TheNextBigThing™ and skimp on fundamentals of Computer Science, and frankly it feels stupid. But who knows, maybe I&rsquo;m the stupid one for thinking that because AI will make it redundant in a few years.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to follow <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, or SICP, as many other people call i</p>
<h3 id="sicp">SICP</h3>
<p>I first came to know of this book from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming">teachyourselfcs.com</a>. And it has been recommended by a lot of people, . It&rsquo;s also been un-recommended by a lot of people too. I guess it&rsquo;s a very polarizing book. It&rsquo;s still too early to tell on which side I am. But I&rsquo;ll never know if I never tried, so I went with it. The other option was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a>, but given how strong the support was for SICP, I went with it.</p>
<p>Now SICP is old. As in older than me. So naturally it won&rsquo;t be using a language like Rust or Go. No, it uses Lisp, a language developed in the 60s. Also apparently there are &lsquo;dialects&rsquo; of Lisp, and the one the book uses is Scheme. Luckily installing it was a quick and painless process, and was just one Google search away. Someone had already created an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mit-scheme">AUR package</a> for it, not that I should be surprised. Arch is finally coming in handy (insert customary, I Use Arch BTW™), but the pain-to-gain ratio for using Arch still feels unsatisfactorily high. Anyway moving on, Lisp feels syntactically similar</p>

I won't beat around the bush, and will get straight to it. This is the goal: Speedrun the fundamentals of software engineering. Of course, this doesn't mean sacrificing quality, but my aim is to e

I also do want to gain a solid grasp of Computer Science, but I feel like that will demand greater attention, and I definitely do not want to rush that so I'll probably start that one out

## Starting Out

I've decided to follow [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml), or SICP, as many other people call i

### SICP

I first came to know of this book from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming). And it has been recommended by a lot of people, . It's also been un-recommended by a lot of people too. I guess it's a very polarizing book. It's still too early to tell on which side I am. But I'll never know if I never tried, so I went with it. The other option was [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/), but given how strong the support was for SICP, I went with it.

Now SICP is old. As in older than me. So naturally it won't be using a language like Rust or Go. No, it uses Lisp, a language developed in the 60s. Also apparently there are 'dialects' of Lisp, and the one the book uses is Scheme. Luckily installing it was a quick and painless process, and was just one Google search away. Painless, if you don't account for the countless hours I've devoted to Arch. But yes, someone had already created an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mit-scheme) for it, and installing it was a breeze. Lisp feels syntactically sr

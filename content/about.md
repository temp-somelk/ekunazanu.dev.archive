Hi! I am Anchit. I am a first year computer science undergraduate student currently studying at Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru. I like math, statistics, and progressive rock. I am still relatively new to programming, and only have basic knowledge of python, but I am looking forward to learning C and start with competetitve programming in the coming months.

### Blog
Lately, I have been reading [Simon Ser's blogs](https://emersion.fr/), after I went down a rabbit hole of Wayland development. Taking inspiration from his blog, I decided to write about stuff that interests me, and hopefully present the fascinating, but rather intimidating topics in a relatively simple manner. Perhaps, someone might find it useful.

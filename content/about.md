### Blog
For most of my life, I've been passively consuming educational content from all over the internet, be it on YouTube or random blogs. I have always wanted to actively contribute back, but never knew how to. Or to be truthful, have enough drive in me to do it. But I've decided now is the perfect time to start, since I enrolled in college and I can just write about the things I am learning (not limited to just course listings either) to help me learn better too. I'll try to mostly write about things that interest me and hopefully present the fascinating, but rather intimidating topics in a relatively simple manner. I am still very much a beginner so I'm not very confident that I'll do a good job, but I am hoping at least someone might find it useful.

Hi! I am Anchit. You probably know me as nezdezwez on the internet. I am a second year computer science undergraduate student currently studying at Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru. I like math, statistics, progressive rock, and coding. One of them is a lie.

I also like doodling I guess.

## Log

Most smart people I know have their own blogs, and I want to *appear* smart too, so here we are. Okay no, my goal is to be able to become competent enough to write high-quality-production-grade-hyper-fast-efficient-readable-code™ within the next two years. And what better way to learn, than ~~to document what I learn~~ by trying to teach others too, with an added xkcd twist(?) Just kidding; I will be surprised if someone actually finds this useful. But hey, if someone does, I can just pretend it was my goal all along.

## Lab

This is where I shitpost slightly less shitty posts. Hopefully you can expect ~~higher quality~~ more tolerable stuff here. Most of the things here either topics that I find interesting, or the outcome of me experimenting with different stuff.

## Contact

If you want to complain about my lousy writing, point out mistakes in my writing, or send ideas or memes to me, you can at [nezdezwez@tutanota.com](mailto:nezdezwez@tutanota.com). In case you need to send nudes or you need to rigorously verify that all the cringe stuff I send to you is indeed from me, you can download my [minisign key](/misc/public.nezdezwez.key).

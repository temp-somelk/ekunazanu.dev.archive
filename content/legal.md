Most jurisdictions require me to have this page, so here. The most boring page on this site, and most probably most other sites. Anyway, I tried to look up on what the proper way of constructing all sentences using all fancy technical legal jargon, however I still couldn't anything so I'm still not sure of the proper way to this. However pretty much all of the "This is advice for legal pages but this is not legal advice" pages suggested I should have three distinct categories, that outlines how I handle user information and if . So here goes.

## Privacy Policy

There is no analaytics on this website because I'm already aware of my target demographic aka. Nived. The TLDR of the matter is: I do not collect your personal information. This entire section is irrelevant. I cannot speak for GitHub [Pages] though, the platform hosting this site.

## Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with any entity. In fact if my college discovers I write this, I'll probably be rusitcated. . I also do not take any responsibility for the damage I may or may not have done to your computer. I think it's kind of your fault anyway if you decided to follow the advice of a guy who is writing the legal pages of a blog as a joke.

## Why still here

In fact I'm surprised you found this page and decided to continue to read on. There's a reason I didn't want to become a lawyer. Well that and parental pressures.

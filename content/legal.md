Most jurisdictions require me to have this page, so here. The most boring page on this site, and most probably most other sites. Anyway, I tried to look up on what the proper way of constructing all sentences using fancy technical legal jargon, however I still couldn't find anything appropriate, so I'm still not sure of the proper way to this. However pretty much all of the "This is advice for legal pages but this is not legal advice" pages suggested I should have these three distinct categories, that outlines how I handle user information (if any at all). So here goes.

## Privacy Policy

There is no analaytics on this website because I'm already aware of my target demographic aka. Nived. The TLDR of the matter is: I do not collect your personal information. This entire section is irrelevant. I cannot speak for GitHub (Pages) though, the platform hosting this site.

## Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with any entity. In fact if my college discovers I write this, I'll probably be rusitcated. . I also do not take any responsibility for the damage I may or may not have done to your computer. I think it's kind of your fault anyway if you decided to follow the advice of a guy who is writing the legal pages of a blog as a joke.

## Terms of Use

The content on this website is licensed under the [Creative Commons ShareAlike License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), unless specified otherwise. The media aka the shitty graphics and drawings on this site are mine and are published under the same license, unless specified otherwise. The media on this site that I do not own are subject to their own copyright.

In simple terms, you can use the stuff I created anyway you like; just don't sue me, and try to publish it under the same license. Attribution would be nice, but it's the internet and it's unrealistic to expect anyone to, so it's not really necessary.

## Go Away

Finally, I'm surprised you found this page in the first place, and on top of that decided to continue to read on. There's a real possibility you might be a nerd. Anyway, I am bored of writing this; there's a reason I didn't want to become a lawyer. Well that and parental pressures.

Go on then, go away. Read some actual [stuff](/lab) instead of this useless shit.
